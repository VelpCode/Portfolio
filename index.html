              I am an euntrepreneur at heart, I am using programming as a tool to implement
              my ideas and hopefully start something big someday. That being said I am completly fine with 
              a fulltime programming job, but that will not fully satisfy me, I will constantly create and innovate to try and build
              more opportunities.
