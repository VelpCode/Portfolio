    <p>I am an up & coming developer with a strong drive to build, create & help</p>
    <p>You will be seeing a lot more amazing projects from me in the future, I am just getting started!</p>
    <p>I'm a very sociable person who likes working out, learning and having a good time in general</p>
    <p>I love coding because of <span class = "ammu">the ability to constantly create & constantly test until something works</span>. I do plan on going
        into the entrepreneurial side of tech in the future, but for now I just want to build and work.
    </p>
